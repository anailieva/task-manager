# Task Manager Application

This Task Manager application is a simple Python-based task management system that allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and view all tasks. It will be used as a code base for my DevOps course project @ FMI Sofia University. The project is a complete automated software delivery process with pipelines using some of the main topics covered in the course.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the task list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- View the list of all tasks.
